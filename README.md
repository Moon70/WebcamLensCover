The Aukey PC-LME1 comes without a lens cover, a serious problem you can easily fix using a 3D printer.

This design is meant to be attached to the camera with double-sided adhesive tape.

Best is to print it black. This white version was made for a better contrast on the photo.

Print both objects, the cover and the slider. Put the slider in one groove, then bend it until it slips into the other groove. Use double-sided adhesive tape to stick it on the webcam. IMHO this looks better than those designs which 'wrap around' the camera.
